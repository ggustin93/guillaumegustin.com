      <p class="lead">
      I started in biomedical engineering at UCLouvain, where software first became a way to make health systems more useful to people. Since then, I have built patient-monitoring tools, co-founded the medtech startup MedC2, supported non-profits through digital transformation, and contributed to public-sector platforms. Today at Gate 16, I work on GIS solutions for Brussels Mobility and deepen my practice in responsible AI engineering. In parallel, I run Pwablo, a sustainable web studio for organisations with a social mission.
